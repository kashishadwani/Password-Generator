## Inspiration
  After 3rd semester of my B.tech i had gained the skills of Object Oriented Programming in Java and i wanted to Practically use those concepts somewhere to deepen my knowledge.
  For that i was brainstorming some ideas and in that meantime i created an account on a platform where their requirement was a strong password or else i wasn't allowed to create
  the account only , i tried a lot of my generally used passwords but the strength checking algo didn't approved any. IT WAS SOO FRUSTATING that i came up with an idea to 
  automatically generate a Strong password and to check it's strength on industry defined parameters, AND TADAAA! this project :D
